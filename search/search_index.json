They enable all members of the NAIS team to tune their degree of involvement adjusted to capacity and interest, without splitting up into smaller, more static teams. They ensure ownership, management, and further development of the products the NAIS team are responsible for. They provide us with a forum for subject matter discussions that are narrowed down to the PIG's domain. They enable people outside the NAIS team (our users) to get involved in working with their own platform. The PIG concept is inspired by Kubernetes SIG What is an anchor? \u00b6 Anchors act as a product owner for the products and services included in the PIG. They keep tabs on how the products are experienced and work for the users. They follow the relevant channels, pick up on problems and wishes from users, and ensure that these are addressed in the PIG. Anchors are responsible for ensuring that cases that arise are investigated and end up in a priority order in the (trello board) column for things #TODO. This is often done by consensuses reached in the PIG meetings, but can also be done by both anchors and other members where it is natural. A prioritization of investigated tasks should take into account (but not exclusively) the following aspects: How critical is it? Is it a high value, low hanging fruit? Is it in line with the roadmap? How does it affect the quality of the services we offer? If important tasks remain unhandled due to a lack of capacity in the PIG, it is the anchors' responsibility to inform the NAIS team about this so that we can process this at team level. Anchors are responsible for arranging PIG meetings at an appropriate frequency. If there is a lot of activity in the PIG, it is natural to have weekly meetings, while if there is less, it may hold bi-weekly meetings or only ad-hoc meetings if needed. All meetings should have a notice with an agenda in advance and a minute. In this way, it is easy for everyone in the NAIS team to make an independent assessment of whether this is a meeting you should attend, or whether you can rather work with tasks and initiatives. Since a PIG is a cooperation forum for a given area, much of the work in a PIG will therefore take place locally. It is therefore important that the PIGs communicate openly and ensure that notices, meeting minutes, discussions, designs, decisions, and ADRs are available to others. Keeping these \"interfaces\" as similar as possible across PIGs makes it easier for everyone to consume, as they will be more predictable. Anchors also share a status with the rest of the team on a weekly basis. This should contain a summary of the most important things that have happened in the previous week, and what will happen in the PIG in the future so that the whole team is a little in sync on what is moving. How are tasks distributed? \u00b6 The team members pick the tasks they have the opportunity to contribute to. Each team member is responsible for finding tasks that motivate them, building their own calendar Tetris and otherwise disposing of their time as is best for their situation. One should try to pick the tasks that have been prepared and prioritized, but there are examples where this does not make sense - and that is fine. Where possible, we try to have at least two team members on most tasks - though sometimes it's nice to do things alone too. We avoid starting new things if we can help to complete already ongoing tasks instead. This applies both to those you yourself are actively involved in, and where you see that someone on the team can benefit from your contribution.

Its purpose is remaining a clear separation between tenants and their configuration, whilst still remaining centralized control. An architecture overview \u00b6 The nais-io GCP organization \u00b6 We want a clear separation between the administration of the clusters and the clusters themselves. The nais-io GCP organization serves this purpose; this is where administrative users, configuration and control-plane components reside. What is a GCP organization? Tenant GCP organization \u00b6 Each tenant has its own separate GCP organization. As with the nais-io GCP organization, we want a clear separation between administration and workloads. The nais-management GCP project \u00b6 To achieve this, all tenant wide services (eg. deploy, tenant console, etc.) run in a separate GCP project called nais-management. This GCP project is fully managed and owned by the NAIS team. Tenant environment GCP projects \u00b6 The tenant will have multiple clusters, typically dev and prod, and each of these clusters require a suite of NAIS components (eg. naiserator, monitoring, etc.). To separate NAIS components and from tenant workloads, each cluster has a nais-system namespace, where all NAIS-related services reside. All tenant workloads will run in separate team namespaces in this cluster. What is a GCP project? Administration and authorization \u00b6 Cluster administrators \u00b6 NAIS personnel has an @nais.io user, who initially has no permissions outside of the nais-io GCP organization. There is an administration group in the nais-io GCP organization that is granted access to the respective tenant's GCP organization. This groups is normally empty, but when there is a demand, NAIS operators can grant themselves just in time access by adding their user to this group, and thus access to the tenant. Example: The group nav-k8s-admins@nais.io is granted administrative rights in NAV tenant GCP organization. Cluster users \u00b6 The tenant is responsible for populating their GCP organization with users. This is typically done by synchronizing users from their IDP. Additionally we recommend configuring an IDP, so the tenant remains in control of the authorization flow. Example: Nav synchronize their users from Azure AD and configure Azure AD to be the IDP. Each tenant has their own console where they can manage users, features and access for each of their teams. When a user is allocated to a team, access to resources are granted according to what is configured by the tenant in their console. Control plane and cluster configuration \u00b6 The NAIS control plane consist of two primary components, Fasit and naisd . Fasit is the primary configuration database for all clusters. It runs in the nais-io cluster in the nais-io GCP organization. Naisd is a component that runs in each cluster and is responsible for applying and installing components. When a configuration is ready to be applied to a cluster, Fasit publish a message to a pub/sub-topic specific to the relevant cluster. Naisd picks up the message and applies the configuration. When the configuration is applied, naisd sends a status message on a central status topic. Fasit reads all statuses from all clusters and use this information to give a complete overview of the entire ecosystem. Cluster features \u00b6 All of the components that are available for deployment in a cluster are wrapped in helm-charts. Each component has a github workflow that builds the helm-chart (and if applicable a docker image). The workflow publish each of these artifacts to an artifact registry in the nais-io GCP organization (using workload identity). The chart will normally contain sane defaults for the component, but can be overridden in Fasit on a per cluster basis. The component definition in fasit also caters for dependencies between features. Example: naiserator depends on the nais-crds availability in the cluster in order to work. Naisdevice \u00b6 Every cluster is a private cluster using only private IP-addresses with no direct exposure to the public. In order to reach a cluster, a user is required to run naisdevice , which sets up a VPN tunnel to a naisdevice gateway in the relevant cluster. Anyone who require access to the clusters will have to install naisdevice on their computer. Based on the domain provided in the user's authorization token, the authentication server will grant access to the relevant clusters. Exposing applications \u00b6 Each cluster has a single load balancer and a single set of ingress controllers. Access to each domain on this load balancer is goverened by cloud armor policies. The tenant can restrict which clients can access a domain by defining cloud armor policies. Example: app-a.x.com can be exposed globally, whilst app-b.y.com is restricted to a predefined set of source IPs. The load balancer will terminate SSL using certificates provided by the tenant.","title":"NaaS"},{"location":"technical/naas/#what-is-naas-nais-as-a-service","text":"","title":"What is NaaS (Nais As A Service)?"},{"location":"technical/naas/#introduction","text":"NaaS is a centralized system for governance of NAIS clusters and a uniform way of applying features.

We believe that if our systems conform to the principles in this document, we have a greater chance of achieving these goals. 12 factor app \u00b6 Write your application according to the principles of 12 factor apps . Twelve factor apps: have declarative system requirements, are suitable for deployment in Docker containers, do not have differences between development and production, and can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices. Observability \u00b6 Expose a Prometheus metric endpoint to allow scraping of key application metrics. Measuring success \u00b6 Figure out service level indicators (SLI) and service level objectives (SLO). Service level indicators are quantifying metrics such as error rate , request latency , availability , and system throughput . Service level objectives are targets values for your metrics. You might say that you want an uptime of 99.9%. How do you define uptime? Is it a sufficiently low error rate? Is it being able to serve requests within a reasonable amount of time? Implement SLIs in the application code. Create views in a Grafana dashboard to check up on SLOs. Recommended read: Service Level Objectives in the Google Site Reliability Engineering handbook. Alerts \u00b6 Alerts should be tied to SLOs. Consider if alerting is at all needed. An alert should only fire if human intervention is required. Too many alerts going off will result in alarm fatigue . Relevant logs \u00b6 Ensure traceability of errors by logging sufficient amount of debug information. Do not include sensitive data in logs. Sensitive data include credentials and personally identifyable information. Tests \u00b6 Ensure sufficient test coverage so that the next developer is not afraid of breaking things when updating your code. Documentation \u00b6 Development/building End-user documentation Sysadmin/maintenance Document code where it is complex, hard to read, or otherwise obscure Continuous Integration \u00b6 Ensure that changes to the codebase are built automatically, and pushed to development and production environments. No manual steps other than git push should be neccessary. Publish and announce \u00b6 Your system is not in production until it has users. Make sure all potential end users are aware of your system and can use it. Using a system means making requests and having access to support and documentation. Update skill matrix \u00b6 If a system is not in the skill matrix , add it. If you worked recently on a system, add yourself to the skill matrix. Decrease bus factor \u00b6 Ensure that at least two people on your team have sufficient knowledge to debug and work on the system, to avoid bus factor . Data Protection Impact Assessment \u00b6 Perform, if applicable, a Data Protection Impact Assessment (or in Norwegian, personvernskonsekvensvurdering (PVK)). Security Audit \u00b6 Perform a security audit (ROS) before releasing to production.","title":"Production ready?"},{"location":"technical/production-ready/#what-is-production-ready","text":"This is the NAIS team's attempt to define what production ready means to us.
