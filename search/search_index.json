They enable all members of the NAIS team to tune their degree of involvement adjusted to capacity and interest, without splitting up into smaller, more static teams. They ensure ownership, management, and further development of the products the NAIS team are responsible for. They provide us with a forum for subject matter discussions that are narrowed down to the PIG's domain. They enable people outside the NAIS team (our users) to get involved in working with their own platform. The PIG concept is inspired by Kubernetes SIG What is an anchor? \u00b6 Anchors act as a product owner for the products and services included in the PIG. They keep tabs on how the products are experienced and work for the users. They follow the relevant channels, pick up on problems and wishes from users, and ensure that these are addressed in the PIG. Anchors are responsible for ensuring that cases that arise are investigated and end up in a priority order in the (trello board) column for things #TODO. This is often done by consensuses reached in the PIG meetings, but can also be done by both anchors and other members where it is natural. A prioritization of investigated tasks should take into account (but not exclusively) the following aspects: How critical is it? Is it a low-hanging fruit with lots of value? Is it in line with the roadmap? How does it affect the quality of the services we offer? If important tasks remain unhandled due to a lack of capacity in the PIG, it is the anchors' responsibility to inform the NAIS team about this so that we can process this at team level. Anchors are responsible for arranging PIG meetings at an appropriate frequency. If there is a lot of activity in the PIG, it is natural to have weekly meetings, while if there is less, it may hold bi-weekly meetings or only ad-hoc meetings if needed. All meetings should have a notice with an agenda in advance and a minute. In this way, it is easy for everyone in the NAIS team to make an independent assessment of whether this is a meeting you should attend, or whether you can rather work with tasks and initiatives. Since a PIG is a cooperation forum for a given area, much of the work in a PIG will therefore take place locally. It is therefore important that the PIGs communicate openly and ensure that notices, meeting minutes, discussions, designs, decisions, and ADRs are available to others. Keeping these \"interfaces\" as similar as possible across PIGs makes it easier for everyone to consume, as they will be more predictable. Anchors also share a status with the rest of the team on a weekly basis. This should contain a summary of the most important things that have happened in the previous week, and what will happen in the PIG in the future so that the whole team is a little in sync on what is moving. How are tasks distributed? \u00b6 The team members pick the tasks they have the opportunity to contribute to. Each team member is responsible for finding tasks that motivate them, building their own calendar Tetris and otherwise disposing of their time as is best for their situation. One should try to pick the tasks that have been prepared and prioritized, but there are examples where this does not make sense - and that is fine. Where possible, we try to have at least two team members on most tasks - though sometimes it's nice to do things alone too. We avoid starting new things if we can help to complete already ongoing tasks instead. This applies both to those you yourself are actively involved in, and where you see that someone on the team can benefit from your contribution.

Production implies quality and durability. Running a system means serving requests, and requests are ultimately serving users. We care about our users, thus we must care about our systems. At NAIS, we strive to: provide fully self serviced products with minimal downtime, be confident that code changes will not break existing functionality, respond quickly when systems fail, spend minimal time fixing errors, and most importantly: spend as much time possible implementing useful services for our users. (you!) We believe that if our systems conform to the principles in this document, we have a greater chance of achieving these goals. 12 factor app \u00b6 Write your application according to the principles of 12 factor apps . Twelve factor apps: have declarative system requirements, are suitable for deployment in Docker containers, do not have differences between development and production, and can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices. Observability \u00b6 Expose a Prometheus metric endpoint to allow scraping of key application metrics. Measuring success \u00b6 Figure out service level indicators (SLI) and service level objectives (SLO). Service level indicators are quantifying metrics such as error rate , request latency , availability , and system throughput . Service level objectives are targets values for your metrics. You might say that you want an uptime of 99.9%. How do you define uptime? Is it a sufficiently low error rate? Is it being able to serve requests within a reasonable amount of time? Implement SLIs in the application code. Create views in a Grafana dashboard to check up on SLOs. Recommended read: Service Level Objectives in the Google Site Reliability Engineering handbook. Alerts \u00b6 Alerts should be tied to SLOs. Consider if alerting is at all needed. An alert should only fire if human intervention is required. Too many alerts going off will result in alarm fatigue . Relevant logs \u00b6 Ensure traceability of errors by logging sufficient amount of debug information. Do not include sensitive data in logs. Sensitive data include credentials and personally identifyable information. Tests \u00b6 Ensure sufficient test coverage so that the next developer is not afraid of breaking things when updating your code. Documentation \u00b6 Development/building End-user documentation Sysadmin/maintenance Document code where it is complex, hard to read, or otherwise obscure Continuous Integration \u00b6 Ensure that changes to the codebase are built automatically, and pushed to development and production environments. No manual steps other than git push should be neccessary. Publish and announce \u00b6 Your system is not in production until it has users. Make sure all potential end users are aware of your system and can use it. Using a system means making requests and having access to support and documentation. Update skill matrix \u00b6 If a system is not in the skill matrix , add it. If you worked recently on a system, add yourself to the skill matrix. Decrease bus factor \u00b6 Ensure that at least two people on your team have sufficient knowledge to debug and work on the system, to avoid bus factor . Data Protection Impact Assessment \u00b6 Perform, if applicable, a Data Protection Impact Assessment (or in Norwegian, personvernskonsekvensvurdering (PVK)).

Automatic: working by itself with little or no direct human control. Accountable: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. What is NAIS for? \u00b6 The NAIS platform is there for the development teams, and aims to offer the best conditions for developing quality welfare services for the Norwegian population. We do this by offering solid products that solve real problems at scale. The products are based on technology the nais team believes are technologically sustainable. By using the platform's products and following the platform standards, the teams can focus on solving high value challenges rather than underlying nuts and bolts. The two most important drivers for the further evolution of the platform are technological developments and the needs of the teams. What motivates us? \u00b6 Social mission \u00b6 We contribute to an important societal mission by developing and maintaining a platform that relieves developers and helps product teams succeed. Colleagues \u00b6 We have a good working environment with a positive energy consisting of colleagues who have the independence, passion, competence and will needed to solve our mission. Autonomy \u00b6 We have a great degree of freedom both as individuals and as a team. Within our assignment, we as a team choose which challenges we want to focus on and how we will solve these. As members of the team, we choose which tasks we want to participate in. This gives us a varied day to day life, and ownership of the things we work on. Technology \u00b6 At NAIS, we try to always choose the best tool for the job. We have a low threshold for experimentation, and are not afraid to ditch stuff that doesn't work.
