They enable all members of the NAIS team to tune their degree of involvement adjusted to capacity and interest, without splitting up into smaller, more static teams. They ensure ownership, management, and further development of the products the NAIS team are responsible for. They provide us with a forum for subject matter discussions that are narrowed down to the PIG's domain. They enable people outside the NAIS team (our users) to get involved in working with their own platform. The PIG concept is inspired by Kubernetes SIG What is an anchor? \u00b6 Anchors act as a product owner for the products and services included in the PIG. They keep tabs on how the products are experienced and work for the users. They follow the relevant channels, pick up on problems and wishes from users, and ensure that these are addressed in the PIG. Anchors are responsible for ensuring that cases that arise are investigated and end up in a priority order in the (trello board) column for things #TODO. This is often done by consensuses reached in the PIG meetings, but can also be done by both anchors and other members where it is natural. A prioritization of investigated tasks should take into account (but not exclusively) the following aspects: How critical is it? Is it a low-hanging fruit with lots of value? Is it in line with the roadmap? How does it affect the quality of the services we offer? If important tasks remain unhandled due to a lack of capacity in the PIG, it is the anchors' responsibility to inform the NAIS team about this so that we can process this at team level. Anchors are responsible for arranging PIG meetings at an appropriate frequency. If there is a lot of activity in the PIG, it is natural to have weekly meetings, while if there is less, it may hold bi-weekly meetings or only ad-hoc meetings if needed. All meetings should have a notice with an agenda in advance and a minute. In this way, it is easy for everyone in the NAIS team to make an independent assessment of whether this is a meeting you should attend, or whether you can rather work with tasks and initiatives. Since a PIG is a cooperation forum for a given area, much of the work in a PIG will therefore take place locally. It is therefore important that the PIGs communicate openly and ensure that notices, meeting minutes, discussions, designs, decisions, and ADRs are available to others. Keeping these \"interfaces\" as similar as possible across PIGs makes it easier for everyone to consume, as they will be more predictable. Anchors also share a status with the rest of the team on a weekly basis. This should contain a summary of the most important things that have happened in the previous week, and what will happen in the PIG in the future so that the whole team is a little in sync on what is moving. How are tasks distributed? \u00b6 The team members pick the tasks they have the opportunity to contribute to. Each team member is responsible for finding tasks that motivate them, building their own calendar Tetris and otherwise disposing of their time as is best for their situation. One should try to pick the tasks that have been prepared and prioritized, but there are examples where this does not make sense - and that is fine. Where possible, we try to have at least two team members on most tasks - though sometimes it's nice to do things alone too. We avoid starting new things if we can help to complete already ongoing tasks instead. This applies both to those you yourself are actively involved in, and where you see that someone on the team can benefit from your contribution.
