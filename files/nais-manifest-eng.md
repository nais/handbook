## What is NAIS for?

The NAIS platform is there for the development teams, and aims to offer the best conditions for developing quality welfare services for the Norwegian population. We do this by offering solid products that solve real problems at scale. The products are based on technology the nais team believes are technologically sustainable. By using the platform's products and following the standards in the platform, the teams can focus on solving high value challenges rather than underlying nuts and bolts. The two most important drivers for the further evolution of the platform are technological developments and the needs of the teams.
