# NAIS-Sponsor

## It takes a village to raise a NAIS-developer. 

So for your NAIS spesific onboarding you will be guided by not one sponsor but will be attached to the hip of every [anchor](pigs.md) so that you can gain insight into ~~every~~ as many aspects of NAIS as possible. When you have the general gist og things and feel ready you can either just start picking tasks off the board(s).

Not only the anchors are your sponsors. Every member of the team is - and you should not be apologetic or hold back in terms of reaching out to "whomever" because we have no higher priority than that you settle in and find joy and accomplishment with us.

So if you find yourself wondering about something - keep this in mind:
