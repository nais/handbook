# Fixtures

_The NAIS team might look disorganised to a newcomer and in a certain sense of the word this holds true. However there are a few fixtures in place to ensure a certain degree of progression and consensus._

## The froom

 Thanks to COVID19 we have become "remote ~~first~~ only".
 The froom is our zoom based digital workspace.
 We all hang out in the lobby and join breakout rooms for more in-depth exploration of topics that may not be of general interest.
 Anyone is welcome anywhere but "good manners" apply.
 Make your presence known when joining and if you sense that you will be interupting trains of thought or coding flow, come back later or use Slack instead.
 The froom url is posted in the topic [here](https://nav-it.slack.com/archives/G013UH65QQZ). 

All meeting fixtures are held in The froom. 

Any and all meetings that are deemed unnecessary due to priority or lack of substance are swiftly cancelled and we all go back to _[insert task]_.
	
## Weekly 

- The NAIS weekly takes place every Monday morning at 09:00. 

## Retro
 
- Retros are on a need to relieve pressure basis. You will get an invite if one is scheduled. If you feel that one is needed or have topics you want to address let our esteemed product owner know. 

## PIG-meetings 
 
- Utvikleropplevelse (developer experience) takes place every Tuesday afternoon at 14:30. 

- Kubeops is normally thursday mornings at 09:00 but not reccurring - invites sent to interested parties a few days in advance.
