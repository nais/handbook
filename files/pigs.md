# PlatformInterestGroup (PIG)

NAIS has organized the various areas we work with within interest groups.

Why?
========

PIGer is a mechanism for scaling the team. They enable all members of the NAIS team to adapt their own degree of involvement in relation to capacity and interest, without splitting up into smaller, more static teams.

They ensure ownership and safe management / further development of the products we in the NAIS team are responsible for.

They provide us with a forum for professional discussions that is narrowed down to the PIG's domain.

They enable people outside the NAIS team (our users) to get involved in working with their own platform.

The _PIG concept is inspired by [Kubernetes SIGer] (https://github.com/kubernetes/community)_

What is an anchor?
================

Anchors act as a product owner for the products / services included in the PIG.
They have a conscious relationship with how the products are experienced and work for the users. They follow current channels, pick up on problems and wishes from users, and ensure that this is addressed in the PIG.

Anchors are responsible for ensuring that cases that arise are investigated and end up as short in a priority order in the column for things to be done. This is often done by consensus based on the PIG meetings, but can also be done by both anchors and other members where it is natural.

A prioritization of investigated tasks should take into account (but not exclusively) the following aspects:
- How critical is that?
- Is it a low-hanging fruit with lots of value?
- Is it in line with the roadmap?
- How does it affect the quality of the services we offer?

If important tasks remain due to a lack of capacity in the PIG, it is the anchors' responsibility to inform the NAIS team about this so that we can process this at team level.

Anchors are responsible for arranging PIG meetings at an appropriate frequency. If there is a lot of activity in the PIG, it is natural to have weekly meetings, while if there is less, it may hold bi-weekly meetings or only ad-hoc meetings if needed. All meetings should have a notice with an agenda in advance and a minute.
In this way, it is easy for everyone in the NAIS team to make an independent assessment of whether this is a meeting you should attend, or whether you can rather work with tasks and initiatives.

Since a PIG is a cooperation forum for a given area, much of the work in a PIG will therefore take place locally. It is therefore important that the PIGs communicate openly and ensure that notices, meeting minutes, discussions, designs and decisions / ADRs are available to others.
If these "interfaces" are as similar as possible across PIGs, it will be easier for everyone to find, as it will be more predictable.

Anchors also share a status with the rest of the team on a weekly basis. This should contain a summary of the most important things that have happened in the previous week and that will happen in the PIG in the future so that the whole team is a little in sync on what is moving.

How are tasks distributed?
=========================

The team members pick the tasks they have the opportunity to contribute to. Each team member is responsible for finding tasks that motivate them, adding their own calendar tretis and otherwise disposing of their time as is best for their situation.

One should try to pick the tasks that have been studied and prioritized, but there are examples where this does not make sense - and that is fine.

Where possible, we try to be at least two on most tasks - but sometimes it's nice to do things alone.

We avoid and start new things if we can instead help to complete already ongoing tasks. This applies both to those you yourself are actively involved in, and where you see that someone on the team can benefit from your contribution. Fewer context changes and more focus.
