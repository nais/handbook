# Teams

We build NAIS around the concept of a team, 

We believe that the team should be able to take full responsibility for what they build - in the entirety of it's lifecycle. 
This creates better software and happier teams.

To achieve this, we ensure that each team has their own space where they can experiment, develop and host the stuff they build.
Here they have the full set of permissions, and are only limited by their own imagination.

For more details on how this works technically, head over to [navikt/teams](https://github.com/navikt/teams) and [nais/teams](https://github.com/nais/teams).
