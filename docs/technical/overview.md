## Namespaces

Over the years we have a number of namespaces that we use for different purposes. The ones to know about are:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `nais-system` | Where we deliver NAIS functionality |
| `nais` | Team namespace for NAIS. Custom functionality for NAV |
| `nais-verification` | Test applications for verifying NAIS with alerts |
| `kyverno` | Only [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/) is allowed in here |
| `cnrm-system` | Where [Cloud Native Resource Manager](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/overview) runs. Managed by Google |
