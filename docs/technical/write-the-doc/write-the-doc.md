### NAIS Doc authoring guide

This guide is a highly compressed summary of the doc theory published at [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/)

#### _Di√°taxis identifies four distinct needs, and four corresponding forms of documentation - tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation. It places them in a systematic relationship, and proposes that documentation should itself be organised around the structures of those needs._

To create contents you must determine what you are setting out to do. Are you writing a _Tutorial_, a _How-to guide_, a _Reference_ or is it a comprehensive _Explanantion_ of a concept.

* [**Tutorial**](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/)
    - A tutorial is an experience that takes place under the guidance of a tutor. A tutorial is always learning-oriented.
* [**How-to**](https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides/)
    - How-to guides are directions that guide the reader through a problem or towards a result. How-to guides are goal-oriented.
* [**Reference**](https://diataxis.fr/reference/)
    - Reference guides are technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it. Reference material is information-oriented.
* [**Explanation**](https://diataxis.fr/explanation/)
    - Explanation is a discusive treatment of a subject, that permits reflection. Explanation is understanding-oriented.
* [**Markdown guidelines**](./markdown-guidelines.md)
    - "Style guide" that describes the Markdown conventions to be used when authoring NAIS-docs.
