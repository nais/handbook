# NAIS-Sponsor

### _It takes a village to raise a NAIS-developer_

For your NAIS-specific onboarding you will be guided by not only one sponsor, but you will be attached to the hip of every anchor so that you can gain insight into ~~every~~ as many aspects of NAIS as possible.
When you have the general gist of things and feel ready you can just start picking tasks off the board(s).

Not only the anchors are your sponsors.
Every member of the team is - and you should not be apologetic or hold back in terms of reaching out to "whomever" because we have no higher priority than that you settle in and find joy and accomplishment with us.
You can also attach yourself to anyone that you feel might shed more light on a topic you want to explore further.

So if you find yourself wondering about something - keep this in mind:
It is our duty (not to mention in our own best interest) to make sure you have the tools and understanding that you need - so never forget that no question is too stupid to be worth asking.
