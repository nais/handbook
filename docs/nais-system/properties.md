# Properties of Nais

These are the core properties we strive to uphold and improve in every part of Nais.

## Nais to use
It should be intuitive and effortless - making it easy to get things done.

## Forward-Thinking
We are up-to-date on what's happening in the industry and are always looking for ways to improve the platform.

## Sustained Development Velocity
We build with care, reducing technical debt as we go to maintain a fast and frictionless development experience.

## Cost-Conscious
Being stewards of taxpayer money, we are always looking for ways to optimize costs and reduce waste. We do this on the platform itself, and by providing the teams with cost and utilization insights.

## Secure by Design
Security is not an afterthought. We build resilient solutions and empower teams to protect themselves effectively.
