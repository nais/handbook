# A NAIS day

Every Tuesday in the first week of the cooldown period is a NAIS day.

On this particular Tuesday, those who can attend meet in person at the office.

We start off the day with team discussions around how we work together as a team, and how we can improve.
We launch a thread in the #nais_internal channel a couple of days before to pre-populate our topics.

This continues until lunch, followed by a group demo session to share our work from the last focus period.
We discuss and share ideas until we feel just the right amount of dizzy. That's the signal that it's time to head off to a pub or restaurant for an evening of wining and dining.
