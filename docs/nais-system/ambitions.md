# Ambitions

An ambition is a long-term goal that spans several cycles.
It explains _what_ we want to achieve and _why_ we want to do it.
_How_ we get there is defined and discussed in individual initiatives.

[Initiatives](initiatives.md) define the work we do in a single [cycle](cycle.md), but many of the things we do are pieces of a larger puzzle that spans several cycles.
When we're deciding where we're going and what we want to achieve, we need to look at the big picture and not just the individual pieces. This is why we have ambitions.

Abitions are not timeboxed, nor do they have a strict anatomy like initiatives.
The important thing is that the _what_ and the _why_ is properly explained to allow for a shared understanding of the direction we're heading.
