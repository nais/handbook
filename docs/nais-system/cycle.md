# A NAIS cycle

## Focus period (6 weeks)
Every week during a focus period we have a weekly at noon.

## Cool-down (2 weeks)
- Tuesday in the first week of a cooldown we have a [NAIS day](nais-day.md)
- Cut-off for initiatives is the last day of the first week in cooldown.
- Thursday in the second week we announce the first draft of the next focus period.
  Any adjustments to the draft must be made by the end of the week.
