# The Nais board

[https://github.com/orgs/nais/projects/16/views/1](https://github.com/orgs/nais/projects/16/views/1)

This document describes how the board works and the meaning of it's columns.

## Columns

### Draft

This is where initiatives are placed when they are first created and the shaping takes place.
Whoever has the initiative makes sure relevant people are involved in the shaping process.


### Initiativer (RFC)

Where an initiative is presented to the rest of the team for review and feedback. The initiatives for the next period will be chosen from this column.
Chosen initiatives are moved to the TODO column, while the rest goes back to draft.

This column is cleared when we start a new focus period. The owner of the initiative can then [re-pitch](#re-pitching) it if it's still relevant.

### Minitiativer

Initiatives that we assume will be completed in a few days and can be done in parallel with other initiatives or if there's time to spare.

This column is cleared when we start a new focus period. The owner of the minitiative can then [re-pitch](#re-pitching) it if it's still relevant.

### TODO

Initiatives that are planned for the next period.

### In Progress

Initiatives that are currently being worked on.

### Done

Initiatives that have been completed.

## Re-pitching

Iniatives (or minitiatives) that were not selected in previous cycles are moved back to `Draft`. 
Whoever owns the initiative will decide if it should be re-pitched based on feedback/discussions and if it's still relevant. Re-pitching ideally happens as soon as possible after the new focus period starts, and is done by moving it back to the appropriate column.
