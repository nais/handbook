# The Nais board

https://github.com/orgs/nais/projects/16/views/1

This document describes how the board works and the meaning of it's columns.

## Columns

### Draft

This is where initiatives are placed when they are first created and the shaping takes place.
Whoever has the initiative makes sure relevant people are involved in the shaping process.

The iniatives that were not selected in previous cycles are also placed here, and whoever owns the initiative will decide if it should be re-pitched based on feedback or if it should be archived.

### Initiativer (RFC)

Where an initiative is presented to the rest of the team for review and feedback. The initiatives for the next period will be chosen from this column.
This column will be emptied at the start of each period.
Chosen initiatives are moved to the TODO column, while the rest goes back to draft.

### Minitiativer

Initiatives that we assume will be completed in a few days and can be done in parallel with other initiatives or if there's time to spare.

### TODO

Initiatives that are planned for the next period.

### In Progress

Initiatives that are currently being worked on.

### Done

Initiatives that have been completed.
