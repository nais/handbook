# NAIS system

_NAIS system_ is the name of the process we use to develop NAIS. 

The process a naisified version of [Shape Up from 37signals](https://basecamp.com/shapeup), and has been used since the beginning of 2024. 

## A brief overview

We work in [cycles](cycle.md). Each cycle consists of a six week focus period where we split into smaller groups, usually 2-3 people, working on one or more [initiatives](initiative.md). 

After each focus period we have a two week cool-down. Here we reset, re-orient and make plans for what's next. 

Oh, and we also have [holiday-modes](holiday-mode.md) in the summer and around Christmas.

## Why do we organize our work this way?

- We value focus and deep work. We believe this leads to better solutions and happier team members. Having focus periods creates room for this. 
- Basing our work on initiatives, forces us to be explicit and clear about our ideas. It makes it possible for everyone to keep up with what's happening and take part in the discussions. Bonus: a finished initative together with it's discussions serves as an ADR.
- When working on an initiative, you don't have to start each day wondering what to do. Also, you know that what you do, makes sense. 
- We belive that it creates a healthy commitment towards the rest of the team: namely that during the alotted time, you try to focus and do your best work. 
- Organizing our work this way, makes it possible to have a shared orientation in a large team.
