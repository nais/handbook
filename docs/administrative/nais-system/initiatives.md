# Initiative

The scheduled work we do in our focus periods are described in what we call _initiatives_.

An initiative makes it clear _why_ this should be done, and _how_ it can solve _what_ for _who_. 

The process of taking an idea to a proposed initiative, is typically referred to as _shaping_.

## Anatomy

These are the key components of an initiative:

### Essence

The essence should describe is the core idea and purpose of the initiative.
This should be clear and concise, and ensures that you have solid understanding of the problem. 

In addition this helps the working group make scoping decisions along the way.

### Investment

All iniatives are timeboxed to a certain number of weeks or days. This is the upper limit of how much time we are willing to spend on it, before we do a re-evaluation.

It's important to note that this is not an estimate of how long it will take to complete the initiative, but rather a statement of how much time we feel is reasonable to spend on it given the potential impact.

### Non-goals

During the shaping process, you often identify rabbit holes and critial paths that you don't want to go down. These should be listed as non-goals with an explanation.

### Possible solution

Make sure that there actually exists a path to success by sketching out how one envisions an actual _possible_ solution. 

This exercise ensures that what is proposed is technically feasible. By going through the moving parts involved, you're usually able to detect any obvious show stoppers as well as possible rabbit holes to avoid. These should be listed as [non-goals](#non-goals).

Having worked through this, we can see if we are introducing or removing any components, creating any new dependencies or taking on any new responsibilities. 
Understand the technical and/or human impact is important aspects when evaluating the initiative.

If the solution impacts or involves some parts of Nais, make sure that the relevant people (e.g. anchors) are involved in the shaping process.

Rough sketches can also be helpful to help the working group understand the rough idea you have in mind.

Depending on how clear your understanding of the problem is, this can be a chaotic process where many ideas are thrown around and you find yourself exploring many alternative solutions, refining the essence, and the investment as you go along.
Note that the working group is free to deviate from this as long as the essence is preserved.
