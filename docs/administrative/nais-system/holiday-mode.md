# Holiday modes

During the summer and around Christmas, we have what we call _holiday modes_.
These are week-long periods without dedicated focus sessions, allowing us to self-organize and let work flow more organically. This approach accommodates vacation schedules and provides a refreshing change of pace.

Some suggestions for what to do during holiday modes:

- Work on initiatives, or help out on the boards curated by the anchors. If you're unsure what to do you can ask the anchor of the area you're interested in.
- Work on stuff you've put off during focus periods.
- Write a blog post.
- Check with your team if there's something you can help out with.
