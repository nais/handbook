# Holiday modes

During the summer and around Christmas, we have what we call _holiday modes_.
These are week-long periods where we don't work in dedicated focus periods, but self-organize and let the work flow more organically. This is both because many people are on vacation, but also to break up the rythm a bit.

Some suggestions for what to do during holiday modes:

- Work on initiatives, or help out on the boards curated by the anchors. If you're unsure what to do, it can be a good idea to ask the anchor of the area you're interested in.
- Work on stuff you've put off during focus periods.
- Write a blog post.
- Check with your team if there's something you can help out with.
