# Holiday mode

During the summer and around Christmas, we have what we call _holiday mode_.
These are week-long periods where we don't work with dedicated focus on an initiative, but self-organize and let the work flow more organically. This is both because many people are on vacation, but also to break up the rythm a bit.

Some suggestions for what to do during holiday modes:

- Work on initiatives, or help out on the boards curated by the anchors. If you're unsure what to do you can just ask the anchor of the area you're interested in.
- Work on stuff you've put off during focus periods.
- Write a blog post.
- Check with your team if there's something you can help out with.
