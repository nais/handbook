# A Nais day

Every Tuesday in the first week of the cooldown period is a NAIS day.

Here we meet up in person (if possible) in the office. 

We start off the day with team discussions around how we as a team work together, and how we can improve. 
We launch a thread in the #nais_internal channel a couple of days before to pre-gather some topics.

This goes on until lunch, and after we get together and have demos of what we've been working on the last focus period.
We discuss and share ideas until we feel just the right amount of dizzy. That's the signal that it's time to head off to a pub or restaurant for some food and drink the rest of the evening.
This is organized by our eminent social general, Kim Tore.
