# Fixtures

The NAIS team might look disorganised to a newcomer and in a certain sense of the word this holds true. However there are a few fixtures in place to ensure a certain degree of synchronisation, consensus and progression.

## Froom

Thanks to COVID19 we have become "remote ~~first~~ only". And in case you are wondering; The froom is our zoom based digital workspace. Froom is a portmanteau of *Frode* and *Zoom*. Frode is a popular guy, so his personal Zoom space was where we all gravitated.

We all hang out in the lobby and join breakout rooms for more in-depth exploration of topics that may not be of general interest.
Anyone is welcome anywhere but "good manners" apply.
Make your presence known when joining and if you sense that you will be interupting trains of thought or coding flow, come back later or use Slack instead.
The froom url is posted in the topic [here](https://nav-it.slack.com/archives/G013UH65QQZ). 

All meeting fixtures are held in The froom as well as ad-hoc and sceduled meetings with third parties.

Any and all meetings that are deemed unnecessary due to priority or lack of substance are swiftly cancelled and we all go back to _[insert task]_.
	
## Weekly 

The NAIS weekly takes place Monday at high noon.

 
## Friday Demo 

Friday Demo is held most Fridays and invites are distributed (make some noise if you don't get one). 
This is an informal "show & tell" where any new feature or initative is introduced to the larger "service platform" grouping. 
And when we say informal - we mean informal. 
A rudimentry drawing will do - the idea is to keep everyone abreast of what's going on.
You can have your demo added to the agenda or you can present on the fly.

## Retro
 
Retros are held on "a need to relieve pressure" basis. You will get an invite if one is scheduled. If you feel that one is needed or have topics you want to address let our esteemed product owner know. 

## PIG-meetings 
 
- Utvikleropplevelse (developer experience) takes place every Tuesday afternoon at 14:30. 
- Kubeops is normally Thursday mornings at 09:00 but not reccurring - invites are sent to interested parties a few days in advance.
- Aiven is a biweekly thing - Friday mornings at 09:00.
- Deploy come together Wednesdays from 12:00-13:00.
- Security (Sikkerhet) runs with the obscurity principle and won't say...

## Anchor-forum

Every Friday the big-wigs (aka "PIG-Anchors") meet up every friday for a light session of trello grooming so we have tasks ripe for the picking come "Weekly" the following monday.
